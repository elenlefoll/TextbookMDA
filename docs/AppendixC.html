<p>The Multi-Feature Tagger of English (MFTE) Perl is free to use and was released under an Open Source licence. If you are interested in using the MFTE for your own project, I recommend using the latest version of the MFTE Python, which is much easier to use, can tag many more features, and also underwent a thorough evaluation. Note also that all future developments of the MFTE will be made on the MFTE Python. To find out more, see Le Foll &amp; Shakir <span class="citation" data-cites="lefoll2023">(<a href="references.html#ref-lefoll2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> and <a href="https://github.com/mshakirDr/MFTE" class="uri">https://github.com/mshakirDr/MFTE</a>.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Following Biber (1988), this feature is a type-token ratio measured on the basis of, by default, the first 400 words of each text only. It is thus the number of unique word forms within the first 400 words of each text divided by 400. This number of words can be adjusted in the command used to run the script (see instructions at the top of the MFTE script).</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">This feature is not directly listed in the MFTE output tables; however, it is used as a normalisation basis for many other linguistics features (see Normalisation column). It is calculated by tallying the number of occurrences of the following features: VPRT, VBD, VIMP, MDCA, MDCO, MDMM, MDNE, MDWO and MDWS.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><em>I’ve got a fantastic idea! I didn’t sleep at all last night. Cheap, quick and easy fix!</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Whereas the Biber Tagger and the MAT first identify predicative adjectives and then consider all remaining J.* tags from the Stanford Tagger to be attributive adjectives, the MFTE proceeds the other way around because it is considerably easier to reliably identify attributive adjectives than it is predicative adjectives. Thus, all adjectives (J.*, as tagged by the Stanford Tagger) followed by another adjective, a noun or a cardinal number, or preceded by a determiner are tagged as attributive adjectives. Once these first attributive adjectives have been identified, an additional loop is run to capture any additional attributive adjectives found in lists of attributive adjectives.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><em>That’s right. One of the main advantages of being famous... It must be absolutely wonderful.</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Once attributive adjectives have been identified (see JJAT) and tagged as JJAT, all remaining JJ, JJS and JJR tags are overwritten as JJPR. In addition, ok and okay in the construction <em>BE ok(ay)</em> are also tagged as JJPR. These words are otherwise identified as foreign words (FW) by the Stanford Tagger.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><em>It’s not far to go. I’ll get it from upstairs. It’s downhill all the way. It’s there not here.</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Biber’s (1988: 224) list of place adverbials was taken from Quirk et al. (1985:514ff) but inexplicably excludes many from this list. Those that do not fulfil other major functions were therefore added: <em>downwind, eastward(s), westward(s), northward(s), southward(s), upwards, downwards, elsewhere, everywhere, here, offshore, nowhere, somewhere, thereabout(s)</em> and <em>there</em> (but occurrences of there tagged as existential <em>there</em> (EX) by the Stanford Taggers were ignored). Only occurrences of far which have not previously identified as TIME references (e.g., <em>so far, thus far</em>) or emphatics (e.g., <em>far better, far more</em>) are tagged as PLACE references.</td>

Following Nini (2014: 18), the word <em>soon</em> was not tagged as a time adverbial when followed by the word <em>as</em>. <em>Ago, already, beforehand, prior to</em>, and <em>far</em> (the latter only when proceeded by so or thus and not followed by an adjective or adverb), and <em>am</em> and <em>pm</em> as adverbs were added to the list, as well as <em>yet</em> tokens that have not previously been identified as concessives (CONC).</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Following Biber (1988), this tag is assigned to the all forms of the verb be when followed by a determiner (DT), a possessive pronoun (PRPS) a preposition (IN), or an adjective (JJ). In addition, Nini (2014: 20) improved the Biber Tagger “by taking into account that adverbs or negations can appear between the verb BE and the rest of the pattern. Furthermore, the algorithm was slightly modified and improved: (a) the problem of a double-coding of any existential <em>there</em> followed by a form of BE as a BEMA was solved by imposing the condition that there should not appear immediately before or two before the pattern; (b) the cardinal numbers (CD) tag and the personal pronoun (PRP) tag were added to the list of items that can follow the form of BE.” This latter improvement by Nini, however, resulted in tag questions also being assigned to BEMA. The present algorithm therefore further excludes any occurrences of BE found one or two to the left of a question tag (QUTAG), as well as BE occurrences one or two to the left of a present participle form tagged as PROG or past participle form tagged as PASS.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">This category merges Biber’s (1988) split auxiliaries and split infinitive categories and follows Nini’s (2014: 30) operationalisations. Hence, this tag is assigned every time the infinitive marker <em>to</em> (TO) is followed by one or two adverbs and a verb base form, and every time an auxiliary (any modal verb MD, or any form of DOAUX, or any form of BE, or any form of HAVE) is followed by one or two adverbs and a verb form.

Following Nini (2014: 30), besides was removed from Biber’s original list since it also frequently serves as a conjunct and, in this function, is usually followed by a punctuation mark. Note that Nini’s (2014:30) operationalisation tagged all occurrences of these word forms as prepositions regardless of how they were tagged by the Stanford Tagger. Here, it was decided to improve accuracy by restricting the query to tokens tagged as IN by the Stanford Tagger (thus excluding many RB and RP tokens, e.g., <em>Don’t take it away! Tie her up!

Thus, all adjectives (J.*, as tagged by the Stanford Tagger) followed by another adjective, a noun or a cardinal number, or preceded by a determiner are tagged as attributive adjectives.

In addition, Nini (2014: 20) improved the Biber Tagger “by taking into account that adverbs or negations can appear between the verb BE and the rest of the pattern. Furthermore, the algorithm was slightly modified and improved: (a) the problem of a double-coding of any existential \textit{there} followed by a form of BE as a BEMA was solved by imposing the condition that there should not appear immediately before or two before the pattern; (b) the cardinal numbers (CD) tag and the personal pronoun (PRP) tag were added to the list of items that can follow the form of BE.” This latter improvement by Nini, however, resulted in tag questions also being assigned to BEMA. The present algorithm therefore further excludes any occurrences of BE found one or two to the left of a question tag (QUTAG), as well as BE occurrences one or two to the left of a present participle form tagged as PROG or past participle form tagged as PASS. &amp; Finite verbs &amp; Le Foll, adapted from Nini (2014) \\ \hline</span></span>

Hence, this tag is assigned every time the infinitive marker \textit{to} (TO) is followed by one or two adverbs and a verb base form, and every time an auxiliary (any modal verb MD, or any form of DOAUX, or any form of BE, or any form of HAVE) is followed by one or two adverbs and a verb form.

Following Nini (2014: 30), besides was removed from Biber's original list since it also frequently serves as a conjunct and, in this function, is usually followed by a punctuation mark. Note that Nini's (2014:30) operationalisation tagged all occurrences of these word forms as prepositions regardless of how they were tagged by the Stanford Tagger.

Unlike Biber (1988), no subdivision is made for by-passives and agentless passives. This choice is a) theoretically motivated because passives are too infrequent to be robustly measured at this level of granularity in most texts and b) for practical reasons because the algorithm proposed to identify by-passives resulted in too many false positives  (e.g.,  looking for things that have been made by hand). &amp; Finite verbs &amp; Le Foll \\ \hline</span></span>

British spellings were added. \textit{Afford} and \textit{find}, which can be found on Biber's original list, were removed due to being too polysemous. Note that the phrase \textit{dunno}, which is incorrectly parsed by the Stanford Tagger, was also retagged as \textit{du\_VPRT n\_XX0 no\_VB} and \textit{that no\_VB} tokens are also assigned to this category. &amp; Finite verbs &amp; Le Foll, based on Biber (2006) \\ \hline</span></span>
